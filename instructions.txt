Software Engineer Take Home Test

    1.    In this zip file there is a Keras model saved as an h5 file that has been trained to distinguish between cats and dogs
        a.) Please note that the inputs for the model are images with dimensions (150 x 150 x 3)
        b.) The output of the model (i.e. the prediction) is a single number between 0 and 1.  0 represents the “cats” class and 1 represents the “dog” class
    2.    We would like you to build a REST API in a framework of your choosing that takes in an image as a request and returns a prediction of “Cat” or “Dog”
    3.    Once completed, please create a Dockerfile that can be used to rebuild an image of your API
    4.    Send back the Dockerfile and all associated files with a README for evaluation by the team
        a.) Please send images that you used to test the model and your API so that we can replicate your calls
    5.    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Alex Lee (alex@trendalytics.co)

These instructions are just a baseline, but please feel free to extend your API by adding a test suite, more API endpoints besides just a “predict”, etc.  We will be testing your API thoroughly, so please keep that in mind as you are building this.  Good luck!
